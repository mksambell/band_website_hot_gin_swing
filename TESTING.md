## Code validation

The Hot Gin Swing site has been thoroughly tested. The HTML code for all pages has been validated by the W3C [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/). Some minor errors were identified and have been fixed and retested (see [Bugs: Resolved](#resolved)). All pages now display the following message:

![html ok](/assets/readme-images/html-ok.jpg)

The CSS has been validated with [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator) and no errors or warnings were found. The validator displays the following message:

![css ok](/assets/readme-images/css-ok.jpg)

## Bugs

### Resolved

During validation, two minor errors were identified:

1. Footer - copyright character in footer not closed with semicolon

![Bug 1](/assets/readme-images/bug1.jpg)

2. Footer - duplicate ID - an oversight in development - footer-media-link now declared as a class and relevant CSS amended

![Bug 2](/assets/readme-images/bug2.jpg)


### Unresolved

- The contact form, though acting as expected, does not yet post anywhere. This is something that would need to be addressed before going live.
